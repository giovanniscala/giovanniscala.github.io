The model becomes exactly solvable by considering an atom without permanent dipole moments, whose excitation energy is quasi-resonant with the cavity photon energy, and by neglecting the non resonant (counter-rotating) terms. In this case, after including the decay of either the atom or the cavity mode to a continuum, one is able to derive the well-known phenomenology of quasi-resonant transitions, including the fluorescence triplets. In this work we consider the most general Rabi model, incorporating the effects of permanent atomic electric dipole moments, and, based on a perturbative analysis, we compare the intensities of emission lines induced by rotating terms, counter-rotating terms and parity-symmetry-breaking terms. The analysis reveals that the emission strength related to the existence of permanent dipoles may surpass the one due to the counter-rotating interaction terms, but is usually much weaker than the emission due to the main, resonant coupling. This ratio can be modified in systems with a reduced dimensionality or by engineering the energy spectral density of the continuum.","tags":["Light-matter interaction","Green functions"],"title":"Beyond the Rabi model: light interactions with polar atomic systems in a cavity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giovanni Scala","Francesco V Pepe","Paolo Facchi","Saverio Pascazio","Karolina Słowik"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

We include in this theory the spatial extension of the system, taken into account through its wavefunction. This enables us to overcome the divergence problem of the Green tensor propagator that arises from a point-like approximation of the quantum system. Thus the formalism can be applied to generalize the expressions for the spontaneous emission rate and the Lamb shift for a quantum system defined by a spatially extended dipole. In particular, these quantities can be modified by the asymmetry of the spatial structure of the atomic system as demonstrated in two test-bed examples.","tags":["Light-matter interaction","Green functions"],"title":"Light interaction with extended quantum systems in dispersive media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco V Pepe","Gabriele Chilleri","Giovanni Scala","Danilo Triggiani","Yoon-Ho Kim","Vincenzo Tamma"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The method is based on measuring correlation between intensity fluctuations on two detectors, and provides estimates of the distances separating a remote mask from the source and the detector, even when such information cannot be retrieved by first-order intensity measurements. We show how the sensitivity to such distances is intimately connected to the degree of correlation of the measured interference pattern in different experimental scenarios and independently of the spectral properties of light. Remarkably, this protocol can be also used to measure the distance of remote reflective objects in the presence of turbulence. We demonstrate the emergence of new critical parameters which benchmark the degree of second order correlation, describing the counterintuitive emergence of spatial second-order interference not only in the absence of (first-order) coherence at both detectors but also when first order interference is observed at one of the two detectors.","tags":["second-order interferometry"],"title":"Quantum-inspired distance sensing using thermal light second-order interference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giovanni Scala","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

It should be stressed that, unlike the well known correlation matrix criterion or criterion based on local uncertainty relations, our criteria are linear in the density operator and hence one may find unexplored classes of entanglement witnesses and positive maps.

Here, we consider two different CPI schemes based on chaotic light, both employing ghost imaging, the first one to image the object, the second one to image the focusing element. We characterize their noise properties in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and compare their performances. We find that the SNR can be significantly easier to control in the second CPI scheme involving standard imaging of the object; under adequate conditions, this scheme enables the number of frames for achieving the same SNR to be reduced by 1 order of magnitude.","tags":["correlation plenoptic imaging","second order interferometry"],"title":"Signal-to-noise properties of correlation plenoptic imaging with chaotic light","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?
