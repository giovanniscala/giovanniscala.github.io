An insightful method of solving it in case of Bell correlation inequalities for scenarios with two dichotomic measurements per site - for arbitrary number of parties - was given in Refs. [Phys. Rev. A 64, 010102(R) (2001)] and [Phys. Rev. A 64, 032112 (2001)]. Using complex-valued correlation functions, we generalize their approach to a broader class of Bell scenarios, in which the parties may choose from more than 2 multi-outcome measurements. Although the resulting families of Bell inequalities are not always tight, their coefficients have an intuitively understandable structure.We probe their usefulness by numerically testing their ability to detect Bell nonclassicality in simple interferometric experiments. Moreover, we identify a similar structure in the CGLMP inequality expressed in a correlation-based form, which allows us to generalise it to three parties.","tags":["contextuality","uncertainty relations"],"title":"Avenues to generalising Bell inequalities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Catani Lorenzo","Matthew Leifer","Giovanni Scala","David Schmid","Robert Spekkens"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The existence of nontrivial uncertainty relations in quantum theory is generally considered to be a way in which it entails a departure from the classical worldview. However, this view is undermined by the fact that there exist operational theories which exhibit nontrivial uncertainty relations but which are consistent with the classical worldview insofar as they admit of a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. This prompts the question of what aspects of uncertainty relations, if any, cannot be realized in this way and so constitute evidence of genuine nonclassicality. We here consider uncertainty relations describing the tradeoff between the predictability of a pair of binary-outcome measurements (e.g., measurements of Pauli X and Pauli Z observables in quantum theory). We show that, for a class of theories satisfying a particular symmetry property, the functional form of this predictability tradeoff is constrained by noncontextuality to be below a linear curve. Because qubit quantum theory has the relevant symmetry property, the fact that it has a quadratic tradeoff between these predictabilities is a violation of this noncontextual bound, and therefore constitutes an example of how the functional form of an uncertainty relation can witness contextuality. We also deduce the implications for a selected group of operational foils to quantum theory and consider the generalization to three measurements.","tags":["contextuality","uncertainty relations"],"title":"What is nonclassical about uncertainty relations?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco V Pepe","Gabriele Chilleri","Giovanni Scala","Danilo Triggiani","Yoon-Ho Kim","Vincenzo Tamma"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This kind of interference, emerging from the measurement of the correlation between intensity fluctuations on two detectors, is sensitive to the distances separating a remote mask from the source and the detector, even when such information cannot be retrieved by first-order intensity measurements. We show how the sensitivity to such distances is intimately connected to the degree of correlation of the measured interference pattern in different experimental scenarios and independently of the spectral properties of light. Remarkably, in specific configurations, sensitivity to the distances of remote objects can be preserved even in the presence of turbulence. Unlike in previous schemes, such a distance sensitivity is reflected in the fundamental emergence of new critical parameters which benchmark the degree of second-order correlation, describing the counterintuitive emergence of spatial second-order interference not only in the absence of (first-order) coherence at both detectors but also when first-order interference is observed at one of the two detectors.","tags":["second-order interferometry"],"title":"Distance sensitivity of thermal light second-order interference beyond spatial coherence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gniewomir Sarbicki","Giovanni Scala","Dariusz Chruściński"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Beside the intrinsic physical worth, this problem is an exciting direction of research where geometry unveil where there is entanglement. I am particular fascinating to explore how the set of the quantum states is organized and which are the technique to detect entanglement. In the case of pure states, via Schmidt decomposition or equivalently with singular value decomposition we can answer to the problem. We know also that for the Hilbert space of qubit-qubit and qubit-qutrit the answer via the partial transposition. But, with tripartite qubit or bipartite qutrit, we have no a general answer which solve the problem. Futhermore, for higher dimension, the problem turns out to be NP hard.\nLight-Matter interaction\nWe want to grasp the idea of light and matter. In particular, can we better understand the role of the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum in quantum theory which carries on the spontaneous emission of a quantum system? We studied a two-level quantum system embedded in a dispersive environment and coupled with the electromagnetic field of the vacuum. We expand the theory of light-matter interactions to include the spatial extension of the atomic system, taken into account through its wave–functions, thanks to which we solve the divergence problem related to the Green tensor propagator. In particular, the inclusion of the spatial structure of the atomic system allows us to build interesting application as nanoantennas and other cool devices. Moreover, we can better understand the role of the asymmetry of atomic states with respect to spatial inversion in these quantities.

The model becomes exactly solvable by considering an atom without permanent dipole moments, whose excitation energy is quasiresonant with the cavity photon energy, and by neglecting the nonresonant (counter-rotating) terms. In this case, after including the decay of either the atom or the cavity mode to a continuum, one can derive the well-known phenomenology of quasiresonant transitions, including the fluorescence triplets. In this work we consider the most general Rabi model, incorporating the effects of permanent atomic electric dipole moments. Based on a perturbative analysis, we compare the intensities of emission lines induced by rotating terms, counter-rotating terms, and parity-symmetry-breaking terms in order to identify the parameter regimes in which these different contributions play a significant role. The analysis reveals that the emission strength related to the existence of permanent dipoles may surpass the one due to the counter-rotating interaction terms but is usually much weaker than the emission due to the main, resonant coupling. This ratio can be modified in systems with a reduced dimensionality or by engineering the energy spectral density of the continuum.","tags":["Light-matter interaction","Green functions"],"title":"Beyond the Rabi model: light interactions with polar atomic systems in a cavity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giovanni Scala","Francesco V Pepe","Paolo Facchi","Saverio Pascazio","Karolina Słowik"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Here, we consider two different CPI schemes based on chaotic light, both employing ghost imaging: the first one to image the object, the second one to image the focusing element. We characterize their noise properties in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and compare their performances. We find that the SNR can be significantly easier to control in the second CPI scheme involving standard imaging of the object; under adequate conditions, this scheme enables the number of frames for achieving the same SNR to be reduced by 1 order of magnitude.","tags":["Correlation Plenoptics Imaging","Quantum Imaging","Ghost Imaging"],"title":"Signal-to-noise properties of correlation plenoptic imaging with chaotic light","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne \r**Two** \rThree \r A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?
