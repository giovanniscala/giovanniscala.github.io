abstract: "Correlation plenoptic imaging (CPI) is an imaging technique that exploits the correlations between the intensity fluctuations of light to perform the typical tasks of plenoptic imaging (namely, refocusing out-of-focus parts of the scene, extending the depth of field, and performing three-dimensional reconstruction) without entailing a loss of spatial resolution. Here, we consider two different CPI schemes based on chaotic light, both employing ghost imaging: the first one to image the object, the second one to image the focusing element. We characterize their noise properties in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and compare their performances. We find that the SNR can be significantly easier to control in the second CPI scheme involving standard imaging of the object; under adequate conditions, this scheme enables the number of frames for achieving the same SNR to be reduced by 1 order of magnitude."
