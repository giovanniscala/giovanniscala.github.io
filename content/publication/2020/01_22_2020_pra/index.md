abstract: A family of separability criteria based on correlation matrix (tensor) is provided. Interestingly, it unifies several criteria known before like, e.g., computable cross-norm or realignment criterion (CNNR), de Vicente criterion, and derived recently separability criterion based on symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures (SIC POVMs). It should be stressed that, unlike the well known correlation matrix criterion or criterion based on local uncertainty relations, our criteria are linear in the density operator and hence one may find unexplored classes of entanglement witnesses and positive maps. Interestingly, there is a natural generalization to multipartite scenario using multipartite correlation matrix.We illustrate the detection power of the above criteria on several well known examples of quantum states.
