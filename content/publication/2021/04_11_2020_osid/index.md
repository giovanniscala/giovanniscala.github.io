abstract: Detection power of separability criteria based on a correlation tensor is tested within a family of generalized isotropic state in d1⊗d2. For d1≠d2 all these criteria are weaker than positive partial transposition (PPT) criterion. Interestingly, our analysis supports the recent conjecture that a criterion based on symmetrically informationaly complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVMs) is stronger than realignment criterion.
