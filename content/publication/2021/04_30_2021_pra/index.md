abstract: The Rabi Hamiltonian, describing the interaction between a two-level atomic system and a single-cavity mode of the electromagnetic field, is one of the fundamental models in quantum optics. The model becomes exactly solvable by considering an atom without permanent dipole moments, whose excitation energy is quasiresonant with the cavity photon energy, and by neglecting the nonresonant (counter-rotating) terms. In this case, after including the decay of either the atom or the cavity mode to a continuum, one can derive the well-known phenomenology of quasiresonant transitions, including the fluorescence triplets. In this work we consider the most general Rabi model, incorporating the effects of permanent atomic electric dipole moments. Based on a perturbative analysis, we compare the intensities of emission lines induced by rotating terms, counter-rotating terms, and parity-symmetry-breaking terms in order to identify the parameter regimes in which these different contributions play a significant role. The analysis reveals that the emission strength related to the existence of permanent dipoles may surpass the one due to the counter-rotating interaction terms but is usually much weaker than the emission due to the main, resonant coupling. This ratio can be modified in systems with a reduced dimensionality or by engineering the energy spectral density of the continuum.
