abstract: The Bell inequalities stand at the cornerstone of the developments of quantum theory on both the foundational and applied side. The discussion started as a way to test whether the quantum description of reality is complete or not, but it developed in such a way that a new research area stemmed from it, namely quantum information. Far from being and exhausted topic, in the present paper we present a constructive and geometrically intuitive description of the local polytope and its facets in a bipartite Bell scenario with two dichotomic measurements per party.
