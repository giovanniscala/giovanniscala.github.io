abstract: The theorem developed by John Bell constituted the starting point of a revolution that translated a philosophical question about the nature of reality into the broad and intense field of research of the quantum information technologies. We focus on a system of two qubits prepared in a random, mixed state, and we study the typical behavior of their nonlocality via the CHSH–Bell inequality. Afterward, motivated by the necessity of accounting for inefficiency in the state preparation, we address to what extent states close enough to one with a high degree of nonclassicality can violate local realism with a previously chosen experimental setup.
