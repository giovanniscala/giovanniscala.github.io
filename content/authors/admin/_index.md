Independent researcher in quantum information and quantum optics, currently involved in fundamental problems of Physics. I am seeking no-go theorems for noncontextual ontological models, but I am also pursuing the derivation of new Bell’s inequalities as well as interested in Entanglement Theory and metrology. I also studied light-matter interaction in QED and second-order interferometry methods.
