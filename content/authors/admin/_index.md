Post-Doc in quantum information and quantum optics, currently developing genetic and machine learning algorithms for the optimization problems. Interested in the foundations of quantum theory such as Entanglement Theory, Bell's inequalities, and classical explainable models. I also studied metrology, quantum communication games, light-matter interaction in QED and second-order interferometry methods.
