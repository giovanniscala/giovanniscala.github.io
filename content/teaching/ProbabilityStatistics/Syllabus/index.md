title: Course contents
summary: In this course we introduce the probabilistic methods to understand the basic probability and statistical concepts used in foundations of quantum information. Students will be able to formulate and solve mathematical problems within the probabilistic interpretation of quantum information theory and to translate physical and quantum information problems into mathematical formalism and vice versa.
